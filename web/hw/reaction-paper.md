**Due: March 15, 2021**

The goal of this assignment is to get you thinking about research
related to the ideas of the course and to stimulate ideas for final
projects.  The assignment is a reaction paper, where you write a short
(approximately 5 pages) report that discusses, analyzes, and critiques
at least two papers related to the course material.  You can work in
groups of size 1-3 if you wish; the group does not have to be the same
as the one for your final project.

## Paper selection

Select at least two papers related to the course (broadly construed).
The papers do not have to be developing numerical methods; they could
be applying numerical methods to a domain in which you have interest.
I have [a list of some papers on my to-read list](paper-links.html)
that you may consider, but you certainly should not feel limited to
these.

## Reaction paper

Write an approximately five-page "reaction paper" to the papers you
select.  Your paper should

1. Summarize the technical contributions;
2. Explain how the papers are interesting and related to the course;
3. Critically analyze the papers.

Some questions that you might address in your analysis are:

- What are the limitations or weaknesses of the research, and how
  could these be resolved or improved?
- How could the research be extended?
- Are there particular domains or datasets where the approaches work
  well or poorly?
- How does the research connect to ideas that you have seen in other
  domains or work?

## Submission guidelines

Your paper should be properly typeset and submitted as a PDF on
Canvas.  You can work on and submit in teams of size 1-3; these do not
need to be the same as for your final project.  Please include all of
the team member names and netids on the submission.  Your paper must
include a references section with bibliographic information for the
papers to which you are reacting.
