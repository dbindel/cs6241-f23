I have never believed it possible to have too many books.  You should not think
of these as required reading, but rather as references that you might find
helpful along the way.  All the texts linked on this page are either open or
can be accessed via the Cornell library, though you may need to use
[Passkey](https://www.library.cornell.edu/services/apps/passkey).  We
note abbreviations for the books where we actually assign readings.

If you want to know my take on much of the background for this class,
I recommend [the notes from my own course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4220/2023sp/schedule.html).  I also have some [background notes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6241/2023fa/lec/background.pdf) that might be summarized as "things I might've assumed you knew" (correctly or incorrectly).

I have taught [variants of this course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel//blurbs/nmds.html) before, and you might find some
of them useful as well.

## General Numerics

If you want to refresh your general numerical analysis chops and have fun doing
it, I recommend the _Afternotes_ books by Pete Stewart.  If you would like a
more standard text that covers most of the background relevant to this class,
you may like Heath's book (expanded for the "SIAM Classics" edition).
I was involved in a book on many of the same topics, together with Jonathan
Goodman at NYU.  O'Leary's book on _Scientific Computing with Case Studies_
is probably the closest of the lot to the topics of this course, with
particularly relevant case studies.  And Higham's _Accuracy and Stability of
Numerical Methods_ is a magesterial treatment of all manner of error analysis
(highly recommended, but perhaps not as a starting point).

## Numerical Linear Algebra

I learned numerical linear algebra from Demmel's book, and still tend to go to
it as a reference when I think about how to teach.  Trefethen and Bau is
another popular take, created from when Trefethen taught at Cornell CS.
Golub and Van Loan's book on Matrix Computations ought to be on your shelf
if you decide to do this stuff professionally, but I also like the depth
of coverage in Stewart's _Matrix Algorithms_ (in two volumes).  And Elden's
_Matrix Methods in Data Mining and Pattern Recognition_ is one of the closest
books I've found to the spirit of this course (or at least part of it).

## Numerical Optimization

My go-to book on numerical optimization is Nocedal and Wright, with the book
by Gill, Murray, and Wright as a close second (the two Wrights are unrelated).
For the particular case of convex optimization, the standard reference is
Boyd and Vandeberghe.  And given how much of data fitting revolves around
linear and nonlinear least squares problems, we also mention an old favorite
by Bjorck.

## Machine Learning and Statistics

This class is primarily about numerical methods, but the application (to tasks
in statistics, data science, and machine learning) is important to the shape of
the methods.  My favorite book for background in this direction is Hastie,
Tribshirani, and Friedman, but the first book I picked up (and one I still
think is good) was Bishop.  And while you may decide not to read the entirety
of Wasserman's book, I highly recommend at least reading the preface, and
specifically the "statistics/data mining dictionary".

- [All of Statistics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9), Wasserman

## Math Background

If you want a quick refresher of "math I thought you knew" and prefer something
beyond my own notes, Garrett Thomas's notes on "Mathematics for Machine
Learning" are a good start.  If you want much, much more math for ML (and CS
beyond ML), the book(?) by Gallier and Quaintance will keep you busy for some
time.
